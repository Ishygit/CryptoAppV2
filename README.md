## CryptoAppV2
 
##This is a basic encryption program.

*Also, I introduced a new encoder called **VigenereEncoder**.

_***How it works**_

-Run the program by entering the encoder type **<E|D> <Cyphertype> <Key>**

-Also you can give it a file {filename}.in and it writes to a new {filename}.out
